The film follows a group of strangers from across three New York City neighborhoods\u2014different ages, races, socio-economic backgrounds, work and life experience\u2014who came together after months of Covid-19 isolation to explore, map, paint, shape, recall and bear witness to each others\u2019 Zip Code-determined struggles and imagine justice and repair. After several in-progress showings, the short had its premiere at the Museum of the City of New York in February, 2023. In the Winter and Spring of 2023, when many New Yorkers were eager to forget about the hardships of the pandemic, film showings across several of New York\u2019s boroughs offered the opportunity to reflect on what we had learned from our Covid-19 experiences, what we did well, and how we could do better in the future. Film showings were accompanied by roundtables and conversations and by several community-made films and oral history projects with community partners in venues such as the Centro Civico Cultural Dominicano, the City University of New York, the Museum of the City of New York, DCTV Firehouse Cinema, the Queens World Film Festival and more.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>FILM RUN TIME 19:47 Minutes.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full is-resized\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/zcmp.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/aa1.jpeg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-4069\" width=\"839\" height=\"998\" srcset=\"https:\/\/zcmp.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/aa1.jpeg 800w, https:\/\/zcmp.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/aa1-252x300.jpeg 252w, https:\/\/zcmp.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/aa1-768x913.jpeg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 839px) 100vw, 839px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"\/>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">\u200b\u200bWednesday, April 12, 2023, 4:30-8:00 PM<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><br><strong>What We COULD Do:<br>The Zip Code Memory Project in Conversation with Related Pandemic Initiatives<br>The Forum, Columbia University, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/maps\/place\/601+W+125th+St,+New+York,+NY+10027\/@40.8162528,-73.9583886,17z\/data=!3m1!4b1!4m6!3m5!1s0x89c2f669f22a9041:0xc9f965bfb27588b5!8m2!3d40.8162528!4d-73.9583886!16s%2Fg%2F11h3nw6r69\">601 W 125th St<\/a>.<br>Register <a href=\"https:\/\/www.eventbrite.com\/e\/what-we-could-do-the-zip-code-memory-project-in-conversation-tickets-598555444447?aff=ebdssbcitybrowse\">here<\/a><\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Five-Borough Tour&nbsp;<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>TOGETHER, NOT ALONE had its Upper Manhattan premiere and kicked off its five borough tour at the Museum of the City of New York on February 17, 2023.
