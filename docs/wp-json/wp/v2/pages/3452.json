For example: the importance of being who you are as a facilitator rather than conforming to a particular way of facilitating; giving clear and precise instructions but always leaving room for choice, because \u201cTheater of the Oppressed is all about participants having a choice;\u201d and inviting (not telling) participants to do something, so that they decide what they can and cannot do. In these two sessions, we hoped to begin transferring some tools from TO to participants of the ZCMP. \u201cThe idea of Train the Trainers,\u201d as Sanchez said, \u201cis for you to be leading these workshops in whatever place you feel they need to be done.\u201d<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-small-font-size\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/zcmp.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/06\/cam-1.jpg\">  <em>Header photo: Desiree Rios<\/em><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>George Emilio Sanchez This workshop consisted of two all-day sessions.
