What else could it be? (<a href=\"https:\/\/zcmp.org\/3443-2\/\" data-type=\"page\" data-id=\"3443\">See Rehearsals for Change<\/a>)One after another, participants sprang up in silence and mimed a telephone, a hairdryer, or a microphone. Everyone laughed trying to guess. The exercise reminded us that things are not fixed or static: everything, even a water bottle, can be transformed. As we guessed and discussed these possibilities, we worked together to envision change. How could we bring it about? To build a better, more sustainable and equitable world, we first have to imagine it. Improvisation enabled us to unlearn well-worn paths and responses and to rehearse alternatives. It allowed us to be open to surprise.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Introducing her <em>Tree Visualization <\/em>exercise, workshop leader Noni Carter reminded us that <em>In times of crisis, it is important to be reminded of the potency of vision, both communal and individual, particularly when crafting demands for justice<\/em>.
