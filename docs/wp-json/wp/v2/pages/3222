While acknowledging the social inequities and injustices the pandemic has exposed, might local memories of loss and neglect be transformed into a practice of justice and collective healing? What aesthetic memorial forms and strategies of engagement best foster the work of Repair?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>These roundtables approached the urgency of such challenges in conversations between noted artists who have responded to histories of violence and loss in vastly different geo-political contexts. Their visionary memorial projects have mobilized painful memories, leaving space both for mourning and for imagining potential futures. Each of these artists discussed one project, sharing their process and the challenges faced in creating communities of memory.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"\/>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Why Zip Codes, co-presented with Yale University Public Humanities<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Gregg Gonsalves, Bill Rankin, Jacqueline Wernimont, Jia Zhang<br>Moderated by Laura Kurgan<br>2\/22\/22<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-vimeo wp-block-embed-vimeo wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Why Zip Codes Video_Trimmed.mp4\" src=\"https:\/\/player.vimeo.com\/video\/697015329?h=fb93e0524c&amp;dnt=1&amp;app_id=122963\" width=\"950\" height=\"534\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe>\n<\/div><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Bringing together scholars and activists, this virtual roundtable asked: How has the Zip Code legacy shaped our experience and understanding of the ongoing pandemic?
