Yet through the restorative power of artistic collaboration and community, this exhibition dared to Imagine Repair.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>How has the pandemic affected our lives? Where, in our bodies, do we carry the uncertainties, anxieties and fears it has provoked? Can we heal and grow together?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Following several months of workshops created by the Zip Code Memory Project, this exhibition offered a space in which we could listen to the voices and stories of New Yorkers and invited us to share our own. We could accompany each other in the work of remembering and grieving, in momentous and intimate instances of pain and of joy. The artists in this exhibition searched for forms that convey their responsibility to bear witness to an extraordinary historical moment. They came together here to express a collective desire for renewed hope and a demand for transformative justice.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The exhibition Imagine Repair was on view at the Cathedral of St. John the Divine from April 23 to May 15, 2022. The exhibition was curated by I\u015f\u0131n \u00d6nol, in conversations with multiple workshop participants, Aya Labanieh was assistant curator and Yi\u011fit Eygi served as exhibition assistant.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><br><strong>Participating artists:<\/strong> Virginia Ayress | Birim Bademli | Kamal Badhey | Milagros Batista | Erachie Brown | Cathleen Campbell | Gabriella Canal | Mar\u00eda Jos\u00e9 Contreras | Jordan Cruz | Yves Dossous | Leah Kogen Elimeliah | Yi\u011fit Eygi | Judith Helfand | Chelsea Knight | Sonja Jean Killebrew | Se\u00e7il Koman | Candance Leslie | Sandra Long | Rafael Lozano-Hemmer | Susan Meiselas | Zahied Tony Mohammed | Jim Mutton | Lorie Novak | Desiree Rios | Ana-Ofelia Rodriguez | Eloisa Royal | Rafaelina Tineo | Carrie Mae Weems | Deborah Willis | Zip Code Memory Project Participants<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><br>We are grateful to the <strong>Cathedral of St. John the Divine<\/strong> for their generosity in hosting <em>Imagine Repair<\/em>.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The exhibit was <a href=\"https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2022\/05\/05\/arts\/design\/covid-memorials-grief.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">featured in a New York Times<\/a> in a May 2022 review of exhibitions and events that marked Covid losses.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-small-font-size\"><br><strong>Special Thanks<\/strong> to Juan Arias, Sophus Helle, Fahmida Hussain, Mathew Paul Jinks, Olivia Kay Deming, Sungyoon Lim, Tobias \u00d6nol-N\u00f6bauer, Marian Padron, Alex Pekov, Lindsey Michele Schram, Alex Spitzer, Chlo\u00eb Spitzer, Leo Spitzer, Travis Spitzer, Andr\u00e9a Stanislav, Beka Stecky<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-vimeo wp-block-embed-vimeo wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Imagine Repair Exhibit\" src=\"https:\/\/player.vimeo.com\/video\/801105982?dnt=1&amp;app_id=122963\" width=\"950\" height=\"534\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe>\n<\/div><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-vimeo wp-block-embed-vimeo wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Altar Clip\" src=\"https:\/\/player.vimeo.com\/video\/789905177?dnt=1&amp;app_id=122963\" width=\"950\" height=\"534\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe>\n<\/div><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">EXHIBITION ARTWORKS<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>B\u0130R\u0130M BADEML\u0130<\/strong><br><em>Mapping Bodies in Concert<\/em>, 2022<br>Animation<br>45 seconds loop<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-vimeo wp-block-embed-vimeo wp-embed-aspect-9-16 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Mapping Bodies in Concert\" src=\"https:\/\/player.vimeo.com\/video\/775108009?dnt=1&amp;app_id=122963\" width=\"563\" height=\"1000\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe>\n<\/div><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Credit: Birim Bandeli<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>During our ZCMP workshops with Mar\u00eda Jos\u00e9 Contreras, participants were asked to trace an outline of their bodies on a blank sheet, and mark that outline with the places where they feel the experience of COVID. Birim Bademli collected these body maps in one animation loop, delicately weaving the details of these manifold bodily expressions into one another, and in the process transforming them into a one rich and all-encompassing map. This composite work speaks to a deeply individualized and yet collectively embodied emotional experience, ranging from sharp physical pain to resignation, stress, fear, as well as self-knowledge and hope.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Birim Bademli <\/strong>is a visual artist and animator, born in Istanbul and now based in New York City.

Before lockdown, my brother had me move in with my parents in Long Island. I was not too happy about the idea, but ended up going through with it. My dad was around 80 years old at the time, and was working as a physician in Wyckoff Heights Brooklyn. Due to his age, we tried to convince him not to work, but he was adamant that he loved his job. In those pandemic months, I felt like the guardian for both of my parents. My dad continued working at several nursing homes, but one day he suddenly experienced a sharp pain. A physician himself, he knew something was going on. He immediately went to a doctor, and we found out right then that all his arteries were clogged. My dad went through an emergency surgery followed by three months of recovery. Relatives far and wide told him it was time to retire, but he really struggled with that decision. This series of photographs of my mother and father were taken by me as I was living with them during the pandemic for two years. My mom and I helped my dad through his recovery, just as he had helped so many of his patients through theirs. Much of the series concerns itself with the period in which he underwent heart surgery, but also about our everyday lives together before and after.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Kamal Badhey<\/strong> is a photographer, artist-educator, and independent curriculum designer of South Asian ancestry.

There is no singular narrative that captures them all\u2014every one of us has a personal story to share.

To build this Lost COVID Story Map, the five collaborating artists interviewed their neighbors, especially those whose voices were most likely to be ignored. For the artists, this map was a way of opening the community door. They hope that those outside their neighborhoods will enter and listen.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Yves Dossous<\/strong> is an audio-visual technician who designs and engineers television and radio podcast studios for training facilities.

Her teacher, a master knitter, awakened a lifelong interest in social activism. For 20 years she has been designing and producing classical pieces of wearable art. The past two years have forced her to shift gears. The disproportionate loss of life to Covid-19 in Black and Brown communities is a painful experience.

She served as Chief of Staff to Council Member Guillermo Linares from 1991-97 and worked as Director of Community Development &amp; Gov. Affairs in Broadway Housing Communities from 1997-2020.

Her recent work, \u201cQueer Angels Rising,\u201d is an ongoing series dedicated to the LGBTQ community and inspired by her own experience as the parent of a transgender daughter. \u201cQueer Angels Rising\u201d attempts to redress prejudice by subverting some of the central themes traditionally associated with western ideas of angels as white, blond and uniquely male.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-small-font-size\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/zcmp.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/06\/cam-1.jpg\">  <em>Header and Exhibition Photos by Desiree Rios<\/em><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>During the first two years of the global Coronavirus pandemic, New Yorkers suffered isolation and devastating loss, much of it caused by inequality and neglect.
