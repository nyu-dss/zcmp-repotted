But, as one participant said, <em>You can\u2019t heal what you refuse to see<\/em>. Our workshops and gatherings were conceived to be a process of seeing, listening, acknowledging and, where possible, addressing past wrongs and alleviating present pain in creative, even joyful ways. We accompanied each other in grief and in discovery. Participants collected and recorded stories in their own neighborhoods for the <em>Lost New York City Story Map [link to project in exhibition<\/em> and worked with artist Chelsea Knight on the <em>Depository of Anonymous Feelings [<a href=\"https:\/\/zcmp.org\/exhibition\/\">See project in exhibition<\/a>]<\/em>. The public was invited into a time capsule to <em>Talk to the Future<\/em> about the experiences of the pandemic and to have their voices preserved and inscribed by artist Mar\u00eda Jos\u00e9 Contreras.<em>[<a href=\"https:\/\/zcmp.org\/talk-to-the-future\/\" data-type=\"page\" data-id=\"3147\">SeeTalk to the Future<\/a><\/em>]<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Such small gestures and acts, reiterated and repeated, were acts of care that, we all hoped, would begin to build new forms of sociality and coexistence. <em>We are not alone<\/em>, one of our workshop leaders reminded us, <em>we are here together<\/em>.<em> [<a href=\"https:\/\/zcmp.org\/together-not-alone-2\/\">See the film<\/a><\/em>] The fleeting moments of connection that helped to build a multivocal narrative of the pandemic in our neighborhoods were in themselves acts of repair. Could they also lead us to take greater responsibility for each other, for our communities and our city? Could they provoke us to envision and actively work for more just social and economic structures that could prevent devastation such as the one we were witnessing? For ZCMP, Imagine Repair also meant setting the stage to work together on Demanding Justice.\u00a0<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The pandemic starkly revealed our deeply dysfunctional system \u2014 from health care, to housing, to education, and the structure of work.
