Centuries-long racism, gender violence, and inequality were also ravaging us. The death rates in the ZCMP Zip Codes were dramatically higher than in nearby wealthier neighborhoods. As some ZCMP participants repeatedly noted, \u2018essential\u2019 workers who looked after the sick and dying and delivered food to wealthier neighbors were dying while New Yorkers from more affluent Zip Codes left for country homes. The brutal injustice of the system, however, had long been normalized. Being isolated and confined in the city made the disparities more visible. New Yorkers heard the ambulances and saw the refrigerated trucks filled with bodies. <em>Their bodies are in ice trucks. The bodies have names<\/em>, one participant wrote in his journal. <em>We saw death in front of us in a way that we had never experienced it. said another.

Across the country, people overcame isolation and fear when George Floyd\u2019s televised murder detonated resistance against the normalization of violence. Outraged by that performance of racist power, millions of protestors took to the streets demanding \u201cJustice for George Floyd\u201d and asserting that Black Lives Matter. This widespread anger and consciousness made it seem possible to join together with others to demand justice.&nbsp;<br>Justice, as a right, as a demand, was an aspiration motivating the ZCMP. DEMAND JUSTICE, the Illuminator projected on the fa\u00e7ade of the Cathedral of St. John the Divine.
