Billy pointed out during our IMAGINE REPAIR event in April 2022, do not normally go together in our throw-away culture. The performances and presentations in the Nave of the Cathedral of St John the Divine, however, invited us to imagine how to rebuild some of the connections our communities had lost during Covid. We invited the general public to listen to presentations and participate in performances by people we admire and love from a wider community of thinkers and artists. The many forms of expression\u2013the songs, chants, rants, secular sermons, and clanging of pots\u2013created a space in which our outrage and anger could give way to hope and joy in our togetherness. We placed a sign marked \u201cPresente!\u201d on multiple chairs to hold a space for those who are no longer here. Words and images from that performance event continue to resonate: \u201cI am here. We are here\u201d (Imani Uzuri). \u201cIn these inhuman times, be human.\u201d \u201cLive life!\u201d \u201cLive life with a radical, brave, and courageous imagination.\u201d \u201c Remember that the inequalities we face are man-made.\u201d&nbsp; \u201cWe can\u2019t see the future we want if we can\u2019t see the present in which we live\u201d (Fred Moten). Living, like, \u2018sorrowing,\u2019 like imagining, are active verbs. \u201cRise! Stand up,\u201d Alicia Grull\u00f3n prompted us. \u201cDemand justice.
