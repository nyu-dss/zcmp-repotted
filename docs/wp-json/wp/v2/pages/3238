It\u2019s my belief that it is our moral obligation to respect everyone regardless of their mental consciousness or uniqueness. Staying calm and developing coping skills can be challenging in the middle of a worldwide pandemic. I strongly believe it is imperative for us to live in a community full of love, respect, acceptance and gratitude.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-columns is-layout-flex wp-container-183\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-column is-layout-flow\" style=\"flex-basis:33.33%\">\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"500\" height=\"492\" src=\"https:\/\/zcmpsandbox.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/Sonja-Killebrew-ZCMP.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-2535\" srcset=\"https:\/\/zcmp.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/Sonja-Killebrew-ZCMP.jpg 500w, https:\/\/zcmp.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/Sonja-Killebrew-ZCMP-300x295.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\" \/><\/figure>\n<\/div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-column is-layout-flow\" style=\"flex-basis:66.66%\">\n<p><strong>Sonja J. Killebrew<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sonja J. Killebrew is a writer, an educator, and a self-appointed oral historian. She completed her MFA in creative writing in 2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic. In 2020 she worked from home teaching writing to college students on Zoom and she wrote a dark comedy play about the challenges of going to school on Zoom. After attending no less than eight funerals on Zoom in 2020 and 2021, Sonja decided to begin an oral history project memorializing the lives of Black Americans lost to COVID-19. After hearing on the news that the Black American community was disproportionately affected by COVID-19, Sonja wanted to provide a platform for Black Americans to share their stories about loved ones or friends or acquaintances who they had sadly lost to Covid-19. As a Black American and a descendant of Indigenous Americans, African slaves, and Jamaican heritage, Sonja wanted to record the experiences of Americans who identify as Black. Her goal is to get her recordings in museums such as the Smithsonian National Museum of African History and Culture as primary resources for future generations.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-columns is-layout-flex wp-container-186\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-column is-layout-flow\" style=\"flex-basis:33.33%\">\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"500\" height=\"491\" src=\"https:\/\/zcmpsandbox.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/yigit.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-2537\" srcset=\"https:\/\/zcmp.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/yigit.jpg 500w, https:\/\/zcmp.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/yigit-300x295.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\" \/><\/figure>\n<\/div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-column is-layout-flow\" style=\"flex-basis:66.66%\">\n<p><strong>Yigit Eygi<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yigit Eygi is a media artist and designer, recently completed his masters degree in The New School.
